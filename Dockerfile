# sshd
#
# Simple ssh server to sidecar on to another container, so that you can inspect
# the volumes with the "--volumes-from" option. E.g. if you have an already running
# container called "mycontainer" and you want to inspect the files in the volumes:
#
#   docker run --name mycontainer_sshd -d -p 3802:22 --volumes-from mycontainer markgrimes/sshdaemon
#
# Then you can ssh on to port 3802 and inspect all the files. The password is below
# on the "chpasswd" line (this is intended as a debugging tool hence the publicly
# visible password).
#
# For a more complete (but much larger image size) example see
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/running_ssh_service/
